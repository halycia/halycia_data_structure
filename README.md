<h1 align="left">Data Scructure and sorting algorithms package in python</h1>

<p align="left">
This package aims to gather all knowledge I gained in python this semester (2024.1)
while I was in a Data Structure course. Of course I also practiced these algorithms
with real world context, but this package only has the necessary tools to do so.</p>

<p align="left">
Please, don't mind the amount of comments, this is the first package I have ever created.
This package follows the python docs recomendations.
The algorithms are inspired by the "Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures 
using Python" book, by Brad Miller and David Ranum, Luther College.</p>

In this package you will find algorithms for queue, priority queue, stack, trees, 
graphs, deque, map, list and heaps. You will also find some sorting algorithms.</p>

If you find some problem in the code, please communicate me. Thanks!</p>
